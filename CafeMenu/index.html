    <!--Up until now, you have been limited regarding the presentation and appearance of the content you create. To start taking control, add a style element within the head element.-->
    
     <!--You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
            element {
            property: value;
            }
         Center your h1 element by setting its text-align property to the value center.-->
    <!--You now have three type selectors with the exact same styling. You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:-->

    <!--  <style>
        h1, h2, p {
            text-align: center;
        }
       </style> -->

       <!--you have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.-->

       <!--Now you need to link the styles.css file so the styles will be applied again. Nest a self-closing link element in the head element. Give it a rel attribute value stylesheet and an href attribute value of styles.css.-->
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"/>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute. Add the following within the head element:-->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width initial-scale=1.0"/>

<body>
    <!--The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far. Add a div element inside the body element and then move all the other elements inside the new div.-->
    <!--To apply the class's styling to the div element, add a class attribute to the div element's opening tag and set its value to menu.-->

            <!--Itâ€™s looking good. Time to start adding some menu items. Add an empty article element under the Coffee heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer.-->
            <!--That is kind of what you want, but now it would be nice if the flavor and price were on the same line. p elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element. To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the p elements so they behave more like inline elements. To do that, start by adding a class attribute with the value item to the first article element under the Coffee heading.-->
            
            <article class="item">
                <!--The flavors and prices are currently stacked on top of each other and centered with their respective p elements. It would be nice if the flavor was on the left and the price was on the right. Add the class name flavor to the French Vanilla p element.-->
                <!--That worked, but there is still a little space on the right of the price. You could keep trying various percentages for the widths. Instead, use the back space key on your keyboard to move the p element with the class price next to the p element with the class flavor so that they are on the same line in the editor. Make sure there is no space between them.-->
